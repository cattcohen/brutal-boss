# Brutal Boss

## About This Application

This app is designed to allow users to conduct more productive meetings. It allows users to create meetings and share the meeting URL with others, and then provide real-time feedback about the meeting. 

## Features
- Real Time Chat
- Sharing live meeting URLs
- Instant Feedback Reports

## Technologies Used
- Socket.io
- React
- Boostrap 4
- Node/Express

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
```

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

After confirming that you have an up to date git repository and a Heroku app created, complete the following:

1. Build the React app for production by running the following command:

```
yarn build
```

2. Add and commit all changes to git

3. Push to Heroku

If all previous steps were followed correctly, your application should be deployed to Heroku!
